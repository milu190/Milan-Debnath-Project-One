      <h1>The Thrown Child</h1>
      <p>“She is dead, she is no more”, the examining doctor declared in confidence amid a bunch of people who gathered in the middle of a village house to witness the fate of a three-year-old girl child. The mother of the child was just sitting beside the child and looking at the closed eyes of the child. The girl had an unknown viral disease. This incident happened in the year of 1955 in a place called Naljhara, West Bengal, India. This place is not very far from the ‘temple of technology’ IIT Kharagpur. But, in those days, India was not so advanced, as it is today, in any field of science or technology. People were deeply influenced by superstation and nurtured in malnutrition. A mere influenza could be epidemic and cause of terror among the masses. The availability of doctors or medical centers were almost none. One must travel to the town areas to convince the doctor to come along with him to pay a visit to the patient. If the doctor is convinced than only he accompanied the messenger, otherwise the messenger had to come back empty handedly. Meanwhile, the villagers were preparing for the disposal of the body. The mother of the child was composed in silence and pain. She was reluctant to give away her girl as she still believes that her child will awake from death through a supernatural intervention. Every mother believes that her child can never die. The villagers thought it to be only an emotional outburst. </p>
      <p>The mother of the child was less emotional and stouter on her claim that her child will be brought back to life. Here, the readers must know some glimpses of the mother’s background. The mother was a practitioner of the legacy of Khona, an ancient lady astrologer who existed in medieval Bengal. Khona is said to be the daughter-in-law of Barahmihir, the famous Indian astrologer. Khona had a deep knowledge in climatic change and agricultural science. She made her knowledge available to the uneducated, poor farmers through her colloquial speech which is known as “Khona’s word”. The mother of the child was a follower of such scholarly women. Being the follower of Khona she garnered love and respect among the people. One of the villager asked the mother to hand over the dead body of her daughter. The mother replied, “keep your filthy hands away from my daughter, she is as pure as Ganga”. The villager was astonished and feared to witness such reaction of an aggrieved mother. He asked an old lady who was present there to console the mother. The lady asked some of the old men and women to accompany her to console the mother. They all came closer to the mother and politely asked, “Mother, I can understand your pain, but nothing can be done when fate is so cruel.” This time mother looked mature and replied in a calm voice, “Mother, you are right, when the fate is cruel nothing can be done, but this time the fate is not cruel, he is smiling in disguise.” I have already mentioned the mother was a follower of Khona, the old villagers knew it well and they had respect for her. The villagers joined their palms and bowed to the divine, “Mother, we thought that you are expressing your emotion as a mother, but we forgot that you are a legacy of a divine phenomenon too, please forgive us. Please enlighten us with your divine knowledge”. </p>
      <p>The mother asked everyone to sit properly. Apparently, the gathering became a round table conference centering the mother. The mother started to deliver her speech like a saint, “You all know soul never dies, it’s the body which only dies, but have you ever thought where the soul goes after it leaves a body...?” The obedient villagers looked at each other without any clue. The mother resumed on her own, “ the soul travels through one world to another for a destination…and who transports the soul? It’s the mother Ganga.”  The old lady asked the mother, “Then, mother, let us offer your daughter to Ganga for a peaceful journey.” The mother replied with a little smile on the edges of her lips, “My daughter has already met with Ganga.” All the villagers shocked to hear such a controversial statement. A young man who was preparing the carrier for the dead body with bamboo fence asked the mother bit impolitely, “Mother, how can your daughter meet with Ganga when her dead body is lying on the ground?” The mother looked at her dead child and replied, “ You know Ganga as a flow of water, I meant the Ganga which flows through the galaxy, the akash Ganga (milky way)...” The young man was confused and asked again, “Mother, I really do not understand what you are saying.” The discussion was going on when some religious masters rocked up with some healthy and heavy men. The contemporary society was dominated by these religious masters who are commonly known as priests. The round table conference was disrupted by the arrival of the priests. The villagers stood up in a fear mixed respect. The priests diverted all the attention from the mother to them. One of the priests said, “This lady is trying to manipulate our religious beliefs, a three-year-old child cannot be offered to fire, she must be grounded to mother earth, only the remains of a fire burnt dead body can be offered to mother Ganga.” The mother quickly sat down beside the feet of the priest. </p>
      <p>She requested helplessly, “My lord, please forgive my words, but do not take my child away from me, she is not dead, her time has not come yet”. The priest made a mockery on her claims by saying, “What do you think of yourself, a living God? Or an omnipresent soul? Can you tell me the time of my death?” The mother kept her mouth shut and became very stiff like a stone. The priests ordered their men to take the dead body to the ghat ( place of burial). All the villagers except the ladies joined the funeral procession to the ghat. The mother took a corner in the veranda and placed her head straight parallelly to the wall. All the ladies formed the round table conference again centering the mother. Everyone was silent and expecting a word from the mother. The mother started to speak slowly, “They can never see the truth, greed of power has concealed their knowledge, yet they claim they are very close to God.” The mother was lamenting in grief while the ladies were crying. They all kept silent for a long time. A teenage boy broke the silence who ran into the house. The mother jumped out of the veranda as if she knew someone would come with good news. The mother enquired, “Is she still alive?” The teenager said, “Yes, you are absolutely right, she is not dead”. The mother started to laugh loudly in a thundering voice. The round table conference disrupted once again. All the ladies fall on the feet of the mother. They plead to the mother to forgive them for not believing her words. The mother upheld everyone and asked the teenage boy to tell the full story. The boy said, “When everyone was busy digging up the ground, the dead body propped up on her waist. Everyone ran away thought it to be a ghost. But she could identify everyone by their name.” One of the old ladies asked him, “What happened to the priests?” The boy replied, “The priests asked their men to kill the child, but the villagers beat them up, the priests eloped.” Suddenly, the villagers entered the house with the three-year-old child on their shoulders. The child jumped into the lap of the mother. This child grew up and possessed profound knowledge like her mother. The villagers built an ashram on the name of this ‘thrown child’ which is existing till today. The God has bestowed His mercy on me that I happen to be the son of this ‘thrown child’.</p>
